# Lab1
## This project consists of programs that format strings:
### signs.cpp
  - Removes all punctuation marks and other special characters.  
### vowel.cpp
  - Removes all vowels. There is a string that consists of vowels.  
  - The outer loop iterates through the input string, and the inner loop iterates through the string of vowels.  
  - If a match is found, the variable 'count' is incremented.  
### isPalindrom.cpp
  - Checks if a string is a palindrome.  
  - The function removes spaces from the string and creates a reversed version of it.  
  - Then the original string is compared to the reversed string.
